# Rice Leaf Disease Prediction – Deep Learning Project

Welcome to the **Rice Leaf Disease Prediction** repository!
This project demonstrates a complete deep-learning pipeline that identifies rice leaf diseases from images. Inspired by your earlier project structure , this repository highlights practical machine learning and image classification skills used in real-world agriculture applications.Image based rice leaf disease detection using deep learning for fast and accurate crop diagnosis.


# Project Requirements

### Image Classification (Deep Learning)

#### **Objective**

Develop a deep learning model to classify rice leaf images into disease categories and provide accurate predictions to support early disease detection and better crop health.

---

### **Specifications**

* **Dataset**: Rice leaf images categorized into multiple disease classes (e.g., Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, Leaf Smut).
* **Data Preprocessing**:

  * Resizing & normalization
  * Data augmentation to improve model robustness
* **Model Development**:

  * Build a CNN or use Transfer Learning (VGG16 / ResNet)
  * Train, validate, and evaluate performance
* **Analysis**:

  * Accuracy & loss evaluation
  * Confusion matrix for class-level performance
* **Documentation**:

  * Clear explanation of model design for students and beginners


# Deep Learning Pipeline (Data Analytics)

#### **Objective**

Develop an image-based classification system to deliver insights into:

* Disease type
* Severity patterns
* Healthy vs. unhealthy leaf identification

These insights allow farmers and agricultural analysts to take timely action, preventing large-scale yield loss.


# Model Workflow

1. Load and explore dataset
2. Preprocess & augment images
3. Build CNN / Transfer Learning model
4. Train & evaluate
5. Generate final predictions


# Results & Insights

* High accuracy image classification using deep neural networks
* Model correctly distinguishes between multiple rice leaf diseases
* Early detection helps prevent crop damage and improves productivity
